# trail-of-history-android

This application is a group project organized by the [Charlotte Android Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Charlotte-Android-Developers/) for the [Trail of History](http://charmeck.org/mecklenburg/county/ParkandRec/TrailOfHistory/Pages/default.aspx).

This is a community project distributed over many months. Talks are given monthly about various technical aspects of the application.

The trail of history repository contains source code for two applications. The main app (app module) and an administrative tool called Ranger (ranger module) .

The application uses Firebase as a backend. The setup instructions for firebase are in the [Trail of History data repository](https://github.com/cltmobilemeetup/trail-of-history-data) README. Module specific instructions can be found in the README for the specific module.
